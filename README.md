# Lifespikes
Lifespikes is a company in charge of many projects, most of which are private. At the moment we are making a big effort to ensure that our projects that use a Javascript ecosystem can have global packages that can be shared. At the moment these are the packages we are working on:

- [UI](./packages/ui#README.md): package contains everything related to the UI, using [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components and others created by the Lifespikes team.
